# Parsley Scoreboard

For parser eyes only!!!

This is a shiny app meant to be used with [Parsely](http://www.memento-mori.com/pdf/parsely-pdf "Parsely"), a collection of party games inspired by the text-adventures of the 1980s.Â In order to play this game, you will need a copy of Parsley, as the Scoreboard only contains inventory items and score conditions for each game.
